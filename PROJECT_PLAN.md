## Phase 1 Execution Record

### Objective
Establish trustworthy task data, remove misleading demo behavior, eliminate hardcoded date hacks, and ground all frontend visualizations in actual task state.

### Completed Work by Component

#### 1. Backend Date & Feature Engineering
- **File**: `backend/ml/features.py`
  - Replaced hardcoded October 5, 6, 7 date logic with `parse_calendar_date` and `calculate_days_remaining`.
  - Added robust ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`) and natural date parsing with explicit timezone handling.
  - Dynamically computed `task_age` from `createdAt` or creation timestamp instead of fixed static numbers.
  - Handled overdue tasks with progressive deadline pressure, tasks due today, and tasks with no set deadline.
  - Removed silent fallback substitution of arbitrary fixed days.
- **File**: `backend/ml/model.py`
  - Removed hardcoded default `"October 7"` from Pydantic `TaskInput` schema.
  - Added support for `description`, `createdAt`, `created_at`, `due_date`, and `estimated_effort`.
- **File**: `backend/ml/predict.py`
  - Updated `generate_task_explanation` to handle overdue tasks, tasks due today, and flexible timelines without deadlines.
  - Grounded factor explanations in actual task feature thresholds rather than hardcoded sprint assumptions.

#### 2. Backend Automated Test Suite
- **File**: `backend/tests/test_date_handling.py`
  - 18 comprehensive tests covering ISO format, month names, leap years, overdue detection, boundary checks, and timezone safety.
- **File**: `backend/tests/test_ml_backend.py`
  - Updated test payload from `"October 7"` to dynamic ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
  - Total test suite: **26 tests passing**.

#### 3. Frontend Core & Task Persistence
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
  - Implemented `normalizeTask()` ensuring every task has `id`, `title`, `description`, `dueDate` (ISO), `priority`, `estimatedEffort`, `completed`, `dependencies`, and `createdAt`.
  - Replaced hardcoded initial tasks with `getDefaultTasks()` generating valid dynamic ISO dates.
  - Ensured safe migration path for existing `localStorage` data without losing user tasks.
  - Completely removed `INITIAL_PREDICTIONS`, `INITIAL_MODEL_STATUS`, and `INITIAL_FEATURE_IMPORTANCES` fabricated fallbacks.
  - Enhanced deterministic command parser (`executeCommand`) to parse due dates, effort hours, and priority from natural language input.
  - Integrated genuine browser Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition` / `SpeechRecognition`) with graceful text-input fallback.
  - Passed dynamic user tasks and prediction mapping to `ProjectOverview`.

#### 4. UI De-mocking & Honest State Presentation
- **File**: `src/components/ProjectOverview.jsx`
  - Dynamic user tasks from state, live sprint health calculations.
- **File**: `src/components/MLModelPanel.jsx`
  - Removed hardcoded fallback metrics; displayed honest un-trained / offline states (`—`) when backend is not connected.
- **File**: `src/components/TaskCard.jsx`
  - Removed fallback 50% medium risk for unpredicted tasks; added explicit "Awaiting analysis" badge.
  - Formatted due dates dynamically relative to current calendar date.
- **File**: `src/components/Hero.jsx`
  - Added explicit `✦ ILLUSTRATIVE PREVIEW` badge to hero preview cards.
- **File**: `src/components/CommandBar.jsx`
  - Documented browser Web Speech API honestly.

## Phase 2: Personal Behavioural Telemetry & Durable Persistence

### 1. Persistence Architecture Evaluation & Decision

Before writing the database layer, the deployment and persistence constraints were rigorously evaluated:

1. **Hosted Deployment Reality (Render Web Services)**:
   - VoxPlan is deployed on Render (`https://voxplan-u31l.onrender.com/`). Render free-tier instances have an **ephemeral disk**.
   - Ephemeral disks are reset on every instance spin-down (after 15 minutes of inactivity) and during every redeployment. A backend-only SQLite database stored on the hosted filesystem would silently lose user telemetry and task history.
   - Multiple public visitors accessing the same Render backend would collide on a shared SQLite file unless multi-tenant authentication and tenancy isolation were introduced.

2. **Single-User Personal Planning & Privacy Constraint**:
   - VoxPlan is an intimate personal productivity tool. Telemetry captures granular working habits, active hours, pause patterns, and estimation biases.
   - Forcing telemetry into a remote server without explicit authentication introduces privacy leaks and breaks the core offline-first requirement established in Phase 1.
   - Adding cloud-hosted databases (e.g. Supabase, AWS RDS, Neon) or third-party auth (Firebase, Clerk) violates the project constraints (no external paid databases, no unnecessary cloud auth).

3. **Chosen Architecture: Local-First IndexedDB as Source of Truth + Stable Anonymous Profile ID**:
   - **Engine**: Browser **IndexedDB** (`voxplan_db`, version 1) with object stores:
     - `telemetry_events`: Versioned, immutable event records indexed by `event_id`, `task_id`, `event_type`, and `timestamp`.
     - `tasks`: Durable task records and state.
     - `timer_sessions`: Active and completed working session intervals with start/pause/resume timestamps.
   - **Profile Isolation**: A stable anonymous local profile ID (`voxplan_profile_id`, format: `prof_<uuid>`) is generated on the client and stored in `localStorage` and IndexedDB. Every telemetry event is strictly stamped with this `profile_id`.
   - **Durability**: IndexedDB data survives browser tab closes, full application reloads, offline periods, and machine restarts.
   - **Offline Resilience**: The app can create tasks, track timers, log behavioral telemetry, and compute behavioral statistics completely offline without a running backend.
   - **Optional Backend Batch Ingestion**: FastAPI exposes `/api/telemetry/events` for local testing and batch ingestion, validating profile ownership and deduplicating by `event_id`.
   - **User Agency**: Users can inspect all recorded events in full transparency, export their history as JSON, or permanently wipe their behavioral history with a single click without deleting active tasks.

---

### 2. Completed Implementation by Component

#### A. Versioned Behavioral Event Schema & Validation
- **File**: `src/telemetry/eventSchema.js`
  - Defines `SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` and all 11 event types:
    - `task_created`: `{ title, category, priority, due_date, estimated_effort, dependencies }`
    - `task_started`: `{ session_id, started_at }`
    - `task_paused`: `{ session_id, paused_at, elapsed_seconds }`
    - `task_completed`: `{ completed_at, tracked_duration_seconds, self_reported_duration_seconds, duration_source }`
    - `task_reopened`: `{ reopened_at }`
    - `task_rescheduled`: `{ previous_due_date, new_due_date, reason }`
    - `task_priority_changed`: `{ previous_priority, new_priority }`
    - `task_effort_revised`: `{ previous_effort, new_effort }`
    - `task_reordered`: `{ previous_index, new_index, task_ids_order }`
    - `recommendation_accepted`: `{ recommendation_type, recommendation_id, details }`
    - `recommendation_rejected`: `{ recommendation_type, recommendation_id, details }`
  - Robust `validateEvent()` asserting UUID format, ISO-8601 timestamps, schema version match, and payload structure.
  - Frozen `createEvent()` factory ensuring payload immutability.

#### B. Storage Layer & Telemetry Manager
- **File**: `src/telemetry/indexedDbStore.js`
  - Transactional wrapper around `indexedDB` with object stores: `telemetry_events`, `tasks`, `timer_sessions`.
  - In-memory / localStorage fallback for Node.js test runners and non-browser environments.
- **File**: `src/telemetry/telemetryManager.js`
  - Orchestrates profile initialization (`getOrCreateProfileId()`), event creation, and deduplicated storage.
  - Persists active stopwatch timer state in `localStorage` and IndexedDB, ensuring running timers continue tracking accurately across browser reloads.
  - Provides methods for exporting complete telemetry as JSON (`exportTelemetryJson()`) and wiping history (`clearProfileTelemetry()`) safely.

#### C. Behavioral Statistics Layer
- **File**: `src/telemetry/behavioralStats.js`
  - Reconstructs active task state and computes genuine metrics:
    - `completed_count`: Number of completed tasks.
    - `duration_measured_count`: Tasks with stopwatch-measured duration (`tracked`).
    - `self_reported_count`: Tasks with approximate completion time (`self_reported`).
    - `unknown_duration_count`: Tasks completed without duration.
    - `total_tracked_seconds` & `formatted_tracked_time`.
    - `median_observed_duration_hours`: Median duration computed over measured tasks.
    - `median_by_category`: Categorical breakdown of observed duration.
    - `estimation_accuracy_ratio`: Ratio of median observed duration to median estimated effort.
    - `weekday_distribution`: Completion distribution across Monday through Sunday.
    - `postponements_count`: Total deadline changes and postponements.
  - **Sparse-Data Guard**: Enforces `insufficient_data: true` when completed tasks < 3. Never hallucinates productivity trends from 1 or 2 tasks.

#### D. UI Task Instrumentation & Stopwatch Timer
- **File**: `src/components/TaskCard.jsx`
  - Added dedicated stopwatch control: **Start / Pause / Resume** with live seconds ticker (`⏱️ 00:00`).
  - Added inline due-date rescheduling popup and inline effort revision input, firing `task_rescheduled` and `task_effort_revised` events with previous and new values.
  - Added manual reordering triggers (▲ / ▼), firing `task_reordered`.
  - On task completion without an active timer, opens an optional quick self-reported duration prompt (`"Log time: 15m / 30m / 1h / Skip"`), recording duration honestly as `duration_source: 'self_reported'`.
  - On unmeasured completion, records `duration_source: 'unknown'` without fabricating zero minutes.
- **File**: `src/components/TaskList.jsx`
  - Wired reorder, reschedule, effort revision, and timer handler props to each `TaskCard`.

#### E. Behavioral History & Habit Insights UI
- **File**: `src/components/BehavioralHistoryPanel.jsx`
  - Added Section 04: **Behavioral History & Habit Insights**.
  - Features 4 pastel metric cards:
    - **Completed Tasks**: Total completed vs. timer-tracked vs. self-reported counts.
    - **Focused Time**: Accumulated stopwatch duration with median duration per task.
    - **Estimation Accuracy**: Real ratio of actual duration vs. user's estimated effort with honest bias assessment.
    - **Schedule Adjustments**: Count of deadline changes and postponements.
  - Features **Weekday Rhythm** visual bar distribution showing which days the user actually completes work.
  - Features **Local Privacy Promise**: Explicit documentation that data stays 100% in the browser's IndexedDB, never uploaded or sent to third-party AI models.
  - Includes **Export History (JSON)** and **Clear History** with double-confirmation modal that clears telemetry while preserving active tasks.
- **File**: `src/components/CommandBar.jsx`
  - Updated section numbering to Section 05.
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
  - Initialized telemetry manager on mount.
  - Connected `toggleTaskCompletion`, `cyclePriority`, `handleReschedule`, `handleReviseEffort`, `handleMoveTask`, `handleStartTimer`, and `handlePauseTimer` to telemetry logger.
  - Recorded `recommendation_accepted` when clicking high-risk filter from command bar.
  - Embedded `<BehavioralHistoryPanel />` with live stats subscription.

#### F. Backend Batch Telemetry Endpoints
- **File**: `backend/ml/model.py`
  - Added `TelemetryEventInput`, `TelemetryBatchRequest`, `TelemetryBatchResponse`.
- **File**: `backend/main.py`
  - `POST /api/telemetry/events`: Batch ingestion of validated telemetry events with deduplication.
  - `GET /api/telemetry/events`: Profile-scoped event retrieval.
  - `DELETE /api/telemetry/events`: Profile-scoped history deletion.
- **File**: `backend/tests/test_ml_backend.py`
  - Added test `test_api_telemetry_batch_ingest_and_retrieval` verifying batch storage, deduplication, and profile isolation.

### 3. Automated Test Verification & Results

#### A. Node.js Telemetry Test Suite
- **Command**: `npm test` (`node --test tests/**/*.test.js`)
- **Result**: `14 passed, 0 failed, duration: 128ms`.
  - Event schema validation: UUID format, ISO-8601 dates, schema version, required payload fields.
  - Profile isolation: Separate storage and deletion across different profile IDs.
  - Deduplication: Idempotent event writes with duplicate event IDs.
  - Duration distinctions: `tracked` vs. `self_reported` vs. `unknown`.
  - Rescheduling & priority change tracking: Previous and new value preservation.
  - Sparse data handling: `insufficient_data: true` when completed tasks < 3; genuine median and weekday calculations when tasks >= 3.
  - Task reopening: Accurately adjusts completed task statistics.

#### B. Backend Pytest Suite
- **Command**: `python -m pytest backend/tests/ -v`
- **Result**: `27 passed in 5.15s` (18 date handling tests + 9 API & ML tests including telemetry batch ingestion).

#### C. Frontend Code Quality & Bundle Verification
- **Linter**: `npm run lint` (`oxlint`) -> **0 warnings, 0 errors** across 20 files.
- **Build**: `npm run build` (`vite build`) -> **Successfully generated production bundle** (`dist/assets/index-DAlGQmgN.js`, 455 kB gzip: 143 kB).

### 4. Known Limitations & Transition to Phase 3

1. **Cold-Start Random Forest Model**: The Random Forest classifier remains trained on the synthetic baseline dataset. Phase 2 collected trustworthy behavioral telemetry; Phase 3 will consume this telemetry to adapt model predictions to the user's actual velocity and estimation bias.
2. **Local-First Single Device**: Telemetry is durably persisted in the client's IndexedDB. Cross-device synchronization is not claimed or implemented. Users can export their telemetry as JSON to migrate data if needed.
3. **Statistical Sample Size**: Behavioral metrics require a minimum of 3 completed tasks to display meaningful patterns. The UI explicitly discloses this requirement to prevent misleading premature conclusions.
